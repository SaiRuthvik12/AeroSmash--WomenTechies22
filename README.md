"Games were not just a diversion, I realized. Games could make you feel."
By Sid Meier

In our day-to-day busy schedule one often gets immersed in their work and feels overwhelmed. Individuals get stressed out and cannot work to their full potential which reflects poorly on their work. 

Everyone needs a break to refuel, recharge, and jump back to full throttle. Our goal is to provide a platform for individuals to entertain themselves and take a break from their everyday tasks through gaming.
# How the game works
- The game opens with setting up the user's web cam and opens the start screen of the game.

- The user is intimated to select a difficulty (easy, medium, hard) using hand gestures.

- After choosing the difficulty level the game begins where, enemy jets are spawned at regular intervals randomly on the screen. 

- The user is required to use their hands to destroy the enemy jets and in doing so increases the score of the user. 

- Failing to destroy the enemy jet will result in a loss of life. The game will end once all lives are lost.
